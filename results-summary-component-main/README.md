## My process

-   I started from the mobile view of the app.
-   Arranged the HTML in "boxes".
-   Styled from the topside all the way to the downside of the mobile view.
-   Then switched to desktop and made the last changes on the styling.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   First of all, it's a nice design and I hope that I will remember this kind of arrangement for future projects.
-   Second of all, it was kind of a challenge to get the exact colors as the design outcome.
-   Some extra practice can never hurt you.
-   In the past, I didn't store css values into variables, and this time I tried it and it really made me more efficient.

### Continued development

-   I practice almost every day my algorithms on Codewars.
-   I follow The Odin Project path and soon ill be starting the React lessons from the curriculum.
-   I challenge myself with FronEndMentor so I get used to building stuff that has to look exactly in a way.
