## My process

- First i made the divs for the html parts and added the image.
- Started working on css from the mobile version to the desktop version. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Found this cool hover on the url from css-tricks.com

### What I learned

- Practiced some more my styling. Its good having a design and just work your way through.

### Continued development

- I want to start the react/angular path, so in the future i might try submiting solutions using them.

### Useful resources

- [URL Hover resource](https://css-tricks.com/css-link-hover-effects/) - I wanted an already done simple hover transition. You can find it in that list.
