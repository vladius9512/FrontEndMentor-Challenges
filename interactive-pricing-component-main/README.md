## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was my first time working with an input type range (or at least styling one). Found out that the styling for this input is quite different based on the browser. Also, styling it for Chrome was a little harder than expected. In the end this was indeed a challenge and I had something to learn. Took a break from the project because of summer holiday, and after 3 weeks of break, I fixed the project in a couple of minutes, so a break sometimes helps.

### Continued development

-   I plan to copy as many designs as possible
-   I have a project idea in mind and I think that now I have the skills to at least start the project and work on it
-   I still learn React following The Odin Project
