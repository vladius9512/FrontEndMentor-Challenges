## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

-   First of all, I set up the HTML thinking how many "boxes" I need, and what elements are inside each "box".
-   I created the javascript and the functions I needed to validate the form, while testing to see if they work.
-   Created the style for the page, from the mobile view and afterwards the desktop view.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   I got to practice some more with the form and how to style one.
-   Read a bit on the form and some good practice with it. For example, based on the information I found online, placing the label inside the input isn't a good idea, but the design for this form demanded it to be this way.
-   I got better at estimating the task duration. At least on this project I was almost on point.

### Continued development

-   I practice my html, css and js knowledge with small projects from FrontEndMentor
-   I practice my javascript and problem solving on codewars
-   I follow The Odin Project path and follow its curriculum on what to learn next.

### Useful resources

-   [Forms information](web.dev/learn/forms) - I find some usefull information about what to do on forms. I mean, I built forms before, but some good practice I found by reading on this website.
