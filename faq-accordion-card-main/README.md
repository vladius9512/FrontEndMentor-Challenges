## My process

-   First of all I filled in the HTML with the according elements.
-   Created the javascript and added the event listeners so that it works.
-   Started working on the styling, from mobile view all the way up to the desktop view.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   Actually this project was really helpfull. I never thought that its just an event listener with display:none.
-   Got some real practice with overflow and position: relative/absolute.
-   Practice, practice, practice

### Continued development

-   Improving my problem solving skills using codewars almost daily
-   Challenging myself and learning some nice designs using FronEndMentor
-   Following The Odin Project path for nice project ideas and a guide on what to learn next.

### Useful resources

-   [How to build an FAQ Page](https://sweetcode.io/how-to-build-an-faq-page-with-html-and-javascript/) - I first searched google for some ideas on a FAQ page, and this article helped me. As I said, once you find out how the magic is done, you realise is easier than you thought.
