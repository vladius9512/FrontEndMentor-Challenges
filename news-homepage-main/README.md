## My process

-   Created the html elements and containers
-   Styled the basic mobile view and created the menu
-   Added the js functions so the menu is displayed on click
-   Finished the mobile view
-   Finished the desktop view and added the hover states.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   Haven't practiced grid for a while, and it was a good reminder to use them again in a project.
-   First time I used img srcset and sizes. Its a real game changer now.

### Continued development

-   Trying to do as many frontEndMentor challenges as I can, to keep improving my HTML, CSS and JS solutions on building usefull components.
-   Doing codewars almost daily to work on my problem solving skills
-   Following The Odin Project curriculum
