## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
-   Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

-   I started working on it and placed everything inside the HTML elements as in the design. After doing this, I realised that in a work place, you would want to have a function that builds the notification elements, so you dont do this every time for different projects. So I created a javascript function that creates notification components (probably using React would have been easier)
-   After finishing all the javascript functionalities, I worked on the styling starting from mobile view and then desktop-view.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Grid
-   All the notification elements are built using JS

### What I learned

-   Even though I knew about :nth-child it was the first time I used it
-   I knew the difference between a span and a div, but it was the first time I had to use this while practicing
