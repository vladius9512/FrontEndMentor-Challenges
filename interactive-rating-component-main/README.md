## My process

-   First of all, I created the elements inside the HTML, so I know what I want to have on the page.
-   Then I built the javascript, where I create all the elements in the HTML.
-   Create the logic, so the rating is saved and shown on the next page.
-   Complete the style as close to the design as possible.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   vanilla JS

### What I learned

-   Its always a good practice to do small challenges like this one. Especially on creating the elements inside the js and play with them.

### Continued development

-   I try to practice daily my coding.
-   Training my problem solving skills on codewars.
-   Practicing my HTML, CSS & JS with the help of FrontEndMentor and The Odin Project.
